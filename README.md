# UART_SoC_Design-
SoC design for UART Core using Xilinx ISE. Programmed in Verilog 
Contains core verilog files for the construction of a full duplex synchronous UART. 

==Constraint file must be assembled based on FPGA.
==ROM file must be assembled using kcpsm assembler before synthesis. 

Note: 
== Formatting has been altered from original verilog file upon upload. 
== If downloading directly, format should self correct within xilinx ISE.
